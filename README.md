# Sentence Splitter

:pencil: This is a simple module for [Dfi](https://github.com/peder2911/Diverse_folio_isle) that “spreads” datasets containing rows with multiple sentences into separate sentence-rows for futher analysis. The sentence-tokenizer currently used isn't very good, so i will definitely be updating this script.

:wrench: The script depends on [Agnus_Glare_Tool](https://github.com/peder2911/Agnus_Glare_Tool).
